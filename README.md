## Introduction

Cryptique is a secure file encryption and decryption tool built with Electron and Node.js. It leverages the cryptographic functionality provided by Node.js's `crypto` module to perform AES-256-CBC encryption and decryption of files, ensuring that your sensitive data remains protected.

## ðŸ“š Features

- **File Encryption**: Securely encrypts files using AES-256-CBC and more algorithms, ensuring that data cannot be accessed without the correct password.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypts previously encrypted files with the same password used for encryption.
- **Progress Reporting**: Displays encryption and decryption progress, updating in real-time.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting to help diagnose issues during the encryption or decryption processes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v12.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
- Electron

## ðŸ›  Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/truethari/cryptoque.git
cd cryptoque
```

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Development

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
# For windows
$ npm run build:win

# For macOS
$ npm run build:mac

# For Linux

```

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Encrypting a File

- Open the application.
- Switch to the "Encrypt" tab.
- Select a file using the file picker.
- Enter a secure password in the password field.
- Click "Encrypt File" to begin the encryption process.
- The encrypted file will be saved in the same directory as the original file with a .enc extension.

### Decrypting a File

- Open the application.
- Switch to the "Decrypt" tab.
- Select an encrypted file (.enc) using the file picker.
- Enter the password used during encryption.
- Click "Decrypt File" to begin the decryption process.
- The decrypted file will be restored under the same directory as the encrypted file.
